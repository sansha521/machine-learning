# support vector machine
This repository implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for object recognition using linear, polynomial, and RBF kernels, with hyperparameter tuning via cross-validation. It explores the impact of kernel parameters such as polynomial order, sigma, and regularization constant (C) on classification accuracy. The project includes training and testing on a dataset (`dataset.csv`) and evaluates performance across varying parameter configurations.
